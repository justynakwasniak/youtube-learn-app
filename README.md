## September App — setup and development

📱 About the Project

This is a React Native mobile application I developed as part of a technical interview task for a company.
The app is a YouTube-like simulation, allowing users to browse and watch videos fetched from the YouTube API.

It retrieves videos related to specific keywords — React, React Native, JavaScript, and TypeScript — and displays them in a simple, user-friendly interface.

For video playback, I used the React Native Video library.

After receiving feedback from the reviewers, I implemented best coding practices and improved the project according to their recommendations.

The design of the application was based on screens provided in Figma.

A short guide to install dependencies and run the app (Expo, React Native).

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: recommended LTS (18.x or 20.x). Check: `node -v`.
- **npm**: ships with Node. Check: `npm -v`.
- **Expo**: no global install required; we use `npx`/npm scripts.
- (Optional, Android) **Android Studio** with SDK and an AVD, or a physical device with USB debugging enabled.
- (Web) Any modern browser (Chrome/Edge).

Note (Android): Expo SDK 54 / React Native 0.81 requires **JDK 17**. In Android Studio set JDK 17 in Settings → Build Tools → Gradle → Gradle JDK.

### Install dependencies
From the project directory `c:\1JUSTYNA\september-app`:

```bash
npm install
```

### Run (quick start)
- Start the Expo Dev Server:

```bash
npm run start
```

After the server starts, choose your target (Android emulator, device, Web) in the Expo UI, or use the commands below.

### Android (emulator or device)
1. Launch an Android Emulator in Android Studio (AVD) or connect a device over USB (USB debugging enabled).
2. In the project, run:

```bash
npm run android
```

The first run may take longer (native build). If it does not start, ensure the emulator is running or the device appears in `adb devices`.

### Web

```bash
npm run web
```

This opens the app at a local URL in your browser.

### Environment variables (optional)
The app includes env tooling (`babel-plugin-dotenv-import`, `react-native-dotenv`). If you need keys/API URLs:
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root.
2. Add `NAME=VALUE` pairs.
3. Restart the dev server.

Example:
```env
API_URL=https://example.com
```

### Useful scripts
- `npm run start` — Expo Dev Server (Metro bundler, platform selection).
- `npm run android` — run/build on Android.
- `npm run web` — run in the browser.

### Troubleshooting
- “No Java runtime found”/Gradle errors: configure JDK 17 in Android Studio/`JAVA_HOME`.
- Emulator not connecting: start an AVD before `npm run android` or verify with `adb devices`.
- Env variables not loading: check `.env` formatting and restart `npm run start`.
- Ports in use: close previous Expo/Metro instances or change the port via `expo start` options.

### Project structure (short)
- `app/` — screens/routing (Expo Router).
- `screens/`, `components/`, `styles/`, `utils/` — UI logic and helper modules.
- `android/` — Android project (managed/generated by Expo).

### System requirements (Windows)
- Windows 10/11 (x64/ARM64), PowerShell or CMD.
- For Android: Android Studio Flamingo+ (SDK 34+), Platform Tools (ADB), JDK 17.

If you need iOS instructions or production builds (APK/AAB, signing), let me know and I’ll add a Release section.
